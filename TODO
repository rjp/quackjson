In no particular order:

* Turn messages into threads (tricky without fetching each message).
* Cache message and folder information where possible (messages should be cachable if they can't be edited).
* Add mark_message_read function to UAClient.
* Add auto_read parameter to message fetching functions (or when fetching from cache).
* Change options so that they include the text description as well as the character, so help menus can be auto-generated through one function.
* Attempt to wrap words such that they do not break across lines.
* Allow configuration of client menus.

Major project: Once UAClient is working, write uaHTTP which provides an interface using Flask(?)
