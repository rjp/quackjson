Reimplementation of qUAck in Python and using JSON interface.

If you don't know what qUAck is, this probably doesn't interest you.

CONFIGURATION

Rename qUAckrc.sample to qUAckrc and insert your username and password
for UA. Then:

python run.py

CHANGES FROM ORIGINAL

This version of qUAck uses the JSON interface to UA, which does not support
all of the features of the original qUAck. Some of these will be added to
the client once server support is available, others (e.g. wholist, paging)
may never be implemented due to HTTP being stateless.
